Improved WoTLK Interrupt Bar
================================

By Vendethiel :tm: . Original by Kollektiv.

### Instructions

Don't forget to :
- Rename the folder from wotlk-interruptbar-master to InterruptBar
- If you used an older version of InterruptBar, delete former configuration files : WTF/AccountName/SavedVariables/InterruptBar.lua
- Type `/ib` in-game to see the status.
- To enable the "reuse" mode, type `/ib reuse`. You can confirm it was enabled by typing `/ib`.

### Notes

This version adds an Omnibar-like "show icons on CDs in a row", instead of the default behavior of InterruptBar (order never changes).
